We predict an interstitialcy mechanism with an activation energy of migration of 0.51 eV in the temperature range 800-1100 K. The simulations are consistent with the most recent experiments. The prevalence of oxygen diffusion in the a-b plane accounts for the anisotropy observed in measurements of diffusivity in tetragonal La2NiO4+[small delta].},

In the present perspective article{,} we illustrate the important role of modelling and simulations in providing direct atomic scale insights on the oxygen ion transport mechanisms and conduction properties in the cathode and electrolyte materials{,} and in accelerating the progress from old materials to new concepts. We first summarize the ionic transport mechanisms in the traditional cathode and electrolyte materials which have been widely studied. We then pay our attention to the non-traditional materials and their oxygen transport paths from recent studies{,} focusing on structural and transportanisotropy and lattice dynamics. Lastly{,} we highlight the new developments in the potential to increase the ionic conductivity of the traditional materials through external mechanical stimuli{,} bringing about the mechano-chemical coupling to drive fast ionic transport.},

Anodisation of Ti single grains up to the same potential U yields different oxide thicknesses, anodic charges, donor densities and oxygen evolution. Thin passive layers need less anodic charge qOx for the oxide formation and have a higher donor density Nd. The great extent of oxygen evolution at these grains can be explained by an increased tunnel probability for the transition to the conduction band. The properties vary with the substrate orientation in a systematic manner, indicating a change of the properties at the (0111) orientation.},

  Abstract                 = {We use molecular dynamics in conjunction with an established set of Born model potentials to examine the oxygen ion diffusion mechanism in the double perovskite GdBaCo2O5+[small delta]. We predict that the mechanism of oxygen diffusion is highly anisotropic diffusion occurring only in the Gd-O and adjacent Co-O layers. For GdBaCo2O5.5 the activation energy of oxygen diffusion is 0.5 eV. We investigate the effect that cation disorder of the Gd-Ba sublattice has upon the diffusivity{,} the anisotropy and the diffusion mechanism in GdBaCo2O5+[small delta]{,} which is a model system for double perovskites and other layered compounds. Cation disorder results in a reduction of the oxygen diffusivity and the appearance of diffusion along the c-axis of the material. Oxygen diffusion becomes effectively isotropic when the cation sublattice is disordered.},

  Abstract                 = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently--those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90% and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Chromia protective layers are formed on many industrial alloys to prevent corrosion by oxidation. The role of such layers is to limit the inward diffusion of oxygen and the outward diffusion of cations. A number of chromia-forming alloys contain iron as a major component, such as the stainless steels. To check if chromia is a barrier to the outward diffusion of iron in these alloys, iron diffusion in chromia was studied in both polycrystals and oxide films formed by oxidation of Ni-30Cr alloy in the temperature range 700-1100 °C at an oxygen pressure equal to 10−4 atm. An iron film of about 80 nm thick was deposited on the chromia surface, and after the diffusing treatment, iron depth profiles were established by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Two diffusion domains appear whatever the nature of the chromia material, polycrystals or films. In the first domain, using a solution of the Fick's second law for diffusion from a thick film, effective or bulk diffusion coefficients were determined. With the second domain, Le Claire's and Hart's models allowed both the bulk diffusion coefficient and the grain-boundary diffusion parameter (αDgbδ) to be obtained. Iron bulk and grain-boundary diffusion does not vary significantly according to the microstructure of chromia. The activation energy of grain-boundary diffusion is at least equal or even greater than the activation energy of bulk diffusion, probably on account of segregation phenomena. Iron diffusion was compared to cationic self-diffusion in the bulk and along grain boundaries and related to the protective character of chromia.},

  Abstract                 = {In this research, the influence of crystallographic orientation on pitting corrosion susceptibility of 316LVM stainless steel surface has been investigated using orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) technique. It has been shown that the susceptibility of the surface to pitting corrosion depends strongly on the crystallographic orientation of the planes parallel to the surface. This has revealed an anisotropic nature of pitting initiation on the surface, suggesting that controlling the texture of the material can be considered as a means of ameliorating the material’s pitting resistance. The generalized spherical harmonic functions have been used to express the pitting susceptibility of various crystallographic planes. Using the proposed formula and the texture inverse pole figure of the investigated material (obtained from orientation distribution function, ODF), the pitting susceptibility index (PSI) of the surface is predicted based on texture measurements. The results obtained thus demonstrate a novel method of improving pitting resistance of SS316LVM by designing the desired texture.},
